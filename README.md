# ü§ñ autoSnipe

An autonomous smart contract-based arbitrage bot for Uniswap V3 that monitors price differences and executes profitable trades automatically.

## üöÄ Features

- **Automated Monitoring**: Continuously scans Uniswap V3 trading pairs for price discrepancies
- **Smart Execution**: Automatically executes profitable arbitrage swaps between tokens
- **Owner Controls**: Secure withdrawal system allowing only the contract owner to retrieve funds
- **Gas Optimisation**: Designed to account for gas costs in profit calculations

## üìã Requirements

- Funded Ethereum mainnet account
- Minimum 0.5 ETH for initial liquidity (after accounting for gas fees)
- Access to Remix IDE or similar deployment environment
- Basic understanding of smart contract interactions 

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Deployment

### Step 1: Deploy Contract
1. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org)
2. Import the contract code
3. Ensure your wallet is connected to the Ethereum mainnet
4. Deploy the contract with sufficient ETH balance

### Step 2: Initialize Bot
```solidity
// Call this function to start the arbitrage bot
Start()
```

### Step 3: Monitor & Withdraw
```solidity
// Withdraw profits (owner only)
Withdraw()
```

## üí° How It Works

1. **Price Monitoring**: The bot continuously monitors price differences across Uniswap V3 trading pairs
2. **Opportunity Detection**: Identifies profitable arbitrage opportunities accounting for gas costs
3. **Automated Execution**: Executes trades when profit margin exceeds minimum thresholds
4. **Profit Accumulation**: Successful arbitrage profits are held in the contract for withdrawal

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage Instructions

### Deployment
1. Fund your Ethereum account with at least 0.5 ETH + gas fees
2. Deploy the contract through Remix IDE
3. Verify the contract deployment was successful

### Operation
1. **Start Bot**: Call `Start()` function to begin arbitrage operations

### Financial Risks
- **Loss of Capital**: Market volatility can result in losses exceeding profits
- **Gas Fee Impact**: High network congestion can make trades unprofitable
- **Slippage**: Price movements during execution can reduce or eliminate profits
- **MEV Competition**: Other bots may front-run profitable opportunities

### Technical Risks
- **Smart Contract Bugs**: Potential vulnerabilities in contract code
- **Network Issues**: Ethereum network congestion or failures
- **Oracle Failures**: Price feed dependencies may fail

### Market Risks
- **Low Liquidity**: Insufficient liquidity can prevent profitable execution
- **Rapid Price Changes**: Fast-moving markets can invalidate arbitrage opportunities
- **Competition**: High competition from other MEV bots

## üîß Configuration
